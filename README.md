# External SVG Sprite

### DEPRECATED
Use [external-svg-sprite-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/external-svg-sprite-loader) instead.

A loader and plugin for webpack that converts all your SVGs into symbols and merges them into a SVG sprite.

## Requirements

You will need NodeJS v6+, npm v3+ and webpack.

To make it work in Internet Explorer you will also need [SVG for Everybody](https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody).

## Installation

```bash
npm i external-svg-sprite-loader
```

## Options

### Loader options

- `name` - relative path to the sprite file (default: `img/sprite.svg`).
- `prefix` - value to be prefixed to the icons name (default: `icon`).

### Plugin options

- `emit` - determines if the sprite is supposed to be emitted (default: true). Useful when generating server rendering bundles where you just need the SVG sprite URLs but not the sprite itself.

## Usage

If you have the following webpack configuration:

```js
// webpack.config.js

import path from 'path';
import SvgStorePlugin from 'external-svg-sprite-loader/lib/SvgStorePlugin';

module.exports = {
    module: {
        loaders: [
            {
                loader: 'external-svg-sprite',
                test: /\.svg$/,
            },
        ],
    },
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'public'),
        publicPath: '/',
    },
    plugins: [
        new SvgStorePlugin(),
    ],
};
```

You will be able to import your SVG files in your JavaScript files as shown below.
The imported SVG will always correspond to a JavaScript object with keys `symbol`, `view` and `viewBox`:
- The `symbol` url can be used on a `<use>` tag to display the icon;
- The `view` url is supposed to be used in CSS;
- The `viewBox` value is required by some browsers on the `<svg>` tag.

The URLs will have the following format:
- `symbol`: `webpackConfig.output.publicPath`/`loader.name`#`loader.prefix`-`your-svg-file-name`-`icon-file-hash`
- `view`: `webpackConfig.output.publicPath`/`loader.name`#view-`loader.prefix`-`your-svg-file-name`-`icon-file-hash`

```js
/*
 * {
 *  symbol: '/public/img/sprite.svg#icon-logo',
 *  view: '/public/img/sprite.svg#view-icon-logo',
 *  viewBox: '0 0 150 100'
 * }
 */
import logo from './images/logo.svg';

class {

    render() {
        return (
            <svg viewBox={logo.viewBox}>
                <use xlinkHref={logo.symbol} />
            </svg>
        );
    }
    
}
```

In CSS files, you can import your SVG files as shown bellow (assuming you are using the [ExtractTextPlugin](https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin)).
The imported value will be converted into the `view` url shown above.

```css
.special-icon {
    /* the url will be replaced with the url to the sprite */
    background-image: url('./icons/special.svg') no-repeat 0; 
}
```

## Examples

You can find working examples in the `examples` folder. To test them under the example folder run:

`npm install`

`npm start`

And then you can see the result in `http://localhost:3000`.

## Contributing

First of all, **thank you** for contributing, **you are awesome**.

Here are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews, and discussions before maintainers accept and merge your work:

- Make sure your commit messages make sense (don't use `fix tests`, `small improvement`, `fix 2`, among others).
- Before creating a pull request make sure of the following:
    - your code is all documented properly;
    - your code passes the ESLint rules;
    - variable, function and class names are explanatory enough;
    - code is written in ES2015.
- When creating a pull request give it a name and description that are explanatory enough. In the description detail everything you are adding, do not assume we will understand it from the code.

Thank you!
